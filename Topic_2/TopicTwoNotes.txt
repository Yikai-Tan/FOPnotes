----------------------------------- Lesson 3 -----------------------------------
Data Types #1.1
Primative                Refrence
- Number                  - Object
- String                  - Array(Python List)
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol (Uidd fom GI)

Numeric Operators (like python)
+ is plus
- is minus
* is times
** is power (Evaulated from right to left) ********************IMPTTTTTT
% is modulo with negative numbers ( Remainder )
    Usecases
    - Odd or even checker.
    - Check if its divisible by another number.
/ is division

Shorthand Operators (like python) #2.2
+= means in var editing i=i+1
-= means in var editing i=i-1
*= means in var editing i=i*1
/= means in var editing i=i/1
%= means in var editing i=i%1
**= means in var editing i=i**1

Increment and Decrement Operator #2.3
c:\Users\Yikai\Documents\Fundamentals of Programing (Y1S1)\1 Code\Topic_2\Topic2picture one.HEIC
// Check the code to understand
++var 
var++
--var
var--

Comparison Operators(like python) 
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal 
>= greater than or equal 
== equal 
!= not equal

Boolean Operators (Logic Gates) #2.4
! not
&& and
|| or

Conversion of data Types
taking DT as datatype
use "parseDT"
e.g parseInt

Operator Prescedence
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence

Math Functions
console.log(Math.round(1.115)) // round to nearest int
console.log(Math.floor(1.115)) // round to the floor
console.log(Math.ceil(1.115)) // round to the ceiling

Auto Conversion
JS will auto convert when
a. the str is only numbers
b. the thing that you are doing is -,/,*

JS will not auto convert when
a. + as concat

so how to add str buut make it digit? (Typecasting from python)
- parseFloat (Preserves the float)
- parseInt (Auto Round the Var)
- Number() (More universal)

Typecast to string.
- String()
